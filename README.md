The H/L ratio parameter is commonly applied in 3D stochastic Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) to model the geometry of discontinuities, typically represented as rectangular or elliptical surfaces. This ratio is directly correlated to the shape of the fracture planes generated by the DFN and plays a key role in the dimensional transition between 2D and 3D models.

Given the horizontal and vertical digitized fracture networks (polyline shapefiles) and the interpretation boundary (polygon shapefile), this code calculates an H/L ratio specific to the outcrop by:

1. Fitting statistical distributions to fracture length and height data.
2. Randomly sampling 100 values from both distributions.
3. Sorting values from smallest to largest and pairing them accordingly.
4. Computing the H/L ratio by performing a linear regression on the height data.
5. Repeating the process 1,000 times to account for variability and taking the arithmetic mean as the representative H/L ratio.

To address the limited height of the vertical outcrop, a cut-off can be applied to the height distribution. This cut-off can be either:

1. Static: A fixed threshold.
2. Adaptive: Based on the random samples, calculated as the mean of the vertical sample minus half the interquartile range (IQR) (to reduce the influence of outliers).
